                Gear is at the heart of photography and can be really exciting but, typically, it’s the aspect most people become confused about.

                There’s no necessity to spend a large portion of your budget on high-tech equipment, so keep an open mind and try not to overspend on gadgets that do the same job lighting your product as a $5 piece of card can do. You can probably do this natural light setup for $20 or less if you already own a camera.

        <h1>We care our customer</h1>
        <article >
            Do I like the photographer’s style? Each session should have the same “style”. I have read over and over again that when finding one’s own shooting and processing style, the photographer should think of a few words that they want their clients/viewers to think or feel when seeing their portfolio.  And the words may change over time… but as a whole, is the photographer’s work cohesive? Let’s face it, word of mouth is where most photographers get referrals. And as a customer, I would want to make sure that I’m getting the style that I am paying for. For example, a lifestyle photographer’s images should reflect that style of photography.
