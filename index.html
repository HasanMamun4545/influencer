                Gear is at the heart of photography and can be really exciting but, typically, it’s the aspect most people become confused about.

                There’s no necessity to spend a large portion of your budget on high-tech equipment, so keep an open mind and try not to overspend on gadgets that do the same job lighting your product as a $5 piece of card can do. You can probably do this natural light setup for $20 or less if you already own a camera.
